"""
## Move files between object storage system locations in an MLOps pipeline

This DAG shows the basic use of the Airflow 2.8 Object Storage feature to
copy files between object storage system locations in an MLOps pipeline training
a Naive Bayes Classifier to distinguish between quotes from Captain Kirk and
Captain Picard and provide a prediction for a user-supplied quote.

To be able to run this DAG you will need to add the contents of
`include/ingestion_data_object_store_use_case` to your object storage system, 
install the relevant provider package for your object storage and define an
Airflow connection to it.
If you do not want to use remote storage you can use `file://` for local object
storage and adjust the paths accordingly.
