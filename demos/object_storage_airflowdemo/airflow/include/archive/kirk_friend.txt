We are assembled here today to pay final respects to our honored dead. 
And yet it should be noted that in the midst of our sorrow, 
this death takes place in the shadow of new life, the sunrise of a new world; 
a world that our beloved comrade gave his life to protect and nourish. 
He did not feel this sacrifice a vain or empty one, and we will not debate 
his profound wisdom at these proceedings. Of my friend, I can only say this: 
of all the souls I have encountered in my travels, his was the most... human.
