Considering the marvelous complexity of the universe, its clockwork perfection, 
its balances of this against that... matter, energy, gravitation, time, dimension, 
I believe that our existence must be more than either of these philosophies. 
That what we are goes beyond euclidean or other 'practical' measuring systems... 
and that our existence is part of a reality beyond what we understand now as reality.
