The first duty of every Starfleet officer is to the truth, whether it's scientific truth or historical truth or personal truth! 
It is the guiding principle on which Starfleet is based. 
And if you can't find it within yourself to stand up and tell the truth about what happened, you don't deserve to wear that uniform!
