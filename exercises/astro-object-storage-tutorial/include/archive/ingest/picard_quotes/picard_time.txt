We often refer to space as the final frontier. 
But the older I get, the more I come to believe that the true final frontier is time. 
In command, as in life, what we do in crisis often weighs upon us less heavily 
than what we wish we had done, what could have been. Time offers many opportunities, 
but it rarely offers second chances.
